# JSTestCode
A collection of Node.js test code, for my own learning. Each .js file are meant to be run independently. If you'd like to run each .js file then change directory to whereever you saved the .js file., in the terminal. Insure you have Node.js installed. Then, in the terminal, type "node filename.js". All output will be sent to the terminal.
